/**
 * subtypes and supertypes are related to the concept of inheritance and type relationships.
 * TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that supports the creation of
 * complex types through interfaces, classes, and other constructs
 *
 * A supertype is a more general or broader type that can represent a larger set of values.
 * It is often used as a base or parent type for more specific types.
 *
 * A subtype is a more specific type that inherits from a supertype.
 * It can have additional properties or methods while maintaining the properties and methods of its supertype.
